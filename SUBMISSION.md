# AquaGuardian - Sustainable Aquaponic System Design Platform

## üå± Inspiration / Problem

The global food crisis is intensifying with climate change, population growth, and diminishing arable land. Traditional agriculture consumes 70% of freshwater resources while producing only 60% of the food we need. Urban areas lack access to fresh, locally-grown produce, creating food deserts and increasing carbon footprints from transportation.

**The Problem We're Solving:**
- üåç **Food Security**: 828 million people face acute food insecurity globally
- üíß **Water Scarcity**: Agriculture uses 70% of freshwater but wastes 60% through inefficient methods
- üèôÔ∏è **Urban Food Deserts**: 23.5 million Americans live in areas without access to fresh produce
- üí∞ **High Barrier to Entry**: Aquaponic system design requires expensive consultants and complex calculations
- üîó **Lack of Investment Access**: Small-scale farmers can't access capital for sustainable agriculture
